A text message interface to initiate phone calls, have your place held while in the queue of callers, which then calls and merges you in when your call is answered.

### What it is

This is an early-stage Python app built on Twilio meant to serve as a proof of concept. Currently, using this app you can:

- Initiate a call to a specified number
- Have Twiilio wait while you are on hold waiting for service
- Prompt the service provider to connect with the user when they answer.
- Merge the callers when the prompt is accepted.

The origina idea was from a conversation between @alanjosephwilliams and @lippytak, when discussing their ongoing research. The ideas of @daguar greatly influence how we percieve the potentail value of the service. Further discussion of the idea can be found in the [ideas repo](https://github.com/codeforamerica/health-project-ideas/issues/38).
